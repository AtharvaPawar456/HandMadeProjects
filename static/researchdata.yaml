        # Project Description:
        ======================<br><br>

        - Automated GOLD extractor machine designed for efficient extraction from riverbed soil.
        - Uses multiple filters to separate gold particles from soil material.
        - Extracted gold collected in a final container for further processing.
        - Includes a weight measurement mechanism to quantify extracted gold.
        - Integrates internet connectivity to fetch real-time gold prices and sends email notifications.
        - Features a portfolio tracking system to monitor monthly extraction and earnings.

        # Fast Concept Catchup:
        ======================<br><br>

        - the system takes the soil as an input
        - using multiple filters it seprates the gold from the soil
        - after words the extracted gold is gather in the final container 
        - and then using weight mechine it measures 
        - and then searches the best price of the raw gold on internet and emails you
        - it also tracks your portfolio like how much you have extracted gold and earned this month

        # Problem Statement:
        =====================<br>
        Developing a robust GOLD extractor machine requires integrating hardware and software components to effectively filter and extract gold from riverbed soil, employing Embedded C and Python-Flask for seamless operation. The challenge lies in ensuring precise filtration and measurement accuracy while maintaining reliability in real-time price fetching and portfolio management functionalities.

        # Requirements:
        =====================<br>
        - The soil needs to be from river or any water fall area where their is major water motions 
        - and has posibilities to extract the gold from it
