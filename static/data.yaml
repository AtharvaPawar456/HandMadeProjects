        # Project Description:
        ======================<br><br>

        - Detects theft by stepping on a tile
        - Camera points to the tile
        - Captures and uploads picture to server
        - Website displays picture with timestamp

        <br>
        <br>

        # Fast Concept Catchup:
        ======================<br><br>

        - when system is ON
        - where ever any theft steps on the tile 
        - then the camera will point to that tile 
        - and then capture the picture of the theft 
        - and uploads it to the server
        - the website will show the picture of the theft with timestamp

        # Problem Statement:
        =====================<br>
        Theft detection is crucial for securing premises, but conventional systems often lack real-time responsiveness and accurate targeting. Many systems are unable to precisely capture evidence when a theft occurs, leading to inadequate security measures. This project addresses the need for a responsive and accurate theft detection system that not only identifies the exact location of the theft but also captures and uploads images in real time, enhancing overall security and providing reliable evidence for authorities.

        # Problem Statement:
        =====================<br>
        Practicing organ stitching in robotic surgery requires precise control and feedback to simulate real surgical conditions. Traditional methods may lack the accuracy and responsiveness needed for effective training. This project aims to provide a realistic practice environment by allowing users to control a robotic arm to stitch organs, enhancing their skills and confidence. The system tracks practice trials, providing valuable feedback for continuous improvement, thereby addressing the need for advanced surgical training tools.

      # Project Description:
      ======================<br><br>

      The Secure File Storage System Using Cryptography is a robust solution designed to safeguard sensitive data by employing advanced encryption techniques. This system encrypts files before storing them, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access the contents without the correct decryption keys. It offers a secure way to store and manage sensitive information, making it ideal for both personal and organizational use.

      <br>
      Key features include support for various encryption algorithms, user-friendly interfaces for file encryption and decryption, and secure key management systems to prevent unauthorized access. The system also allows for the secure sharing of encrypted files, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view or modify the data.
      <br>
      Additionally, the system provides detailed logs of file access and encryption/decryption activities, helping users monitor and manage their data security.
      <br>
      Designed with security and ease of use in mind, the Secure File Storage System Using Cryptography ensures that sensitive data remains protected from unauthorized access, providing peace of mind to users.

      # Project Description:
      ======================<br><br>

      The Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Tool Using Fuzzy Logic is designed to evaluate and mitigate cybersecurity risks in IT environments by leveraging fuzzy logic principles. This tool provides a sophisticated approach to risk assessment by handling uncertainty and imprecision inherent in evaluating cybersecurity threats.
      <br>
      <br>
      Key features of the system include the use of fuzzy logic algorithms to model and assess risk factors based on various inputs, such as vulnerability data, threat intelligence, and potential impact. The system generates risk scores and recommendations for mitigation, helping organizations make informed decisions to enhance their cybersecurity posture.
      <br>
      <br>
      The tool provides a comprehensive risk assessment and management solution. It offers user-friendly interfaces for configuring risk parameters, viewing assessment results, and generating reports for stakeholders.
      <br>
      <br>
      Designed to improve the effectiveness of risk management strategies, the Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Tool Using Fuzzy Logic helps organizations address cybersecurity challenges with greater precision and adaptability.
